# üß© User Management Dashboard

A simple and responsive **React.js (Vite)** web application that allows viewing, searching, and adding users.  
This project was created as part of the **Front End Developer Intern assignment** for **UniConverge Technologies Pvt. Ltd.**

## üß† Short Description of My Approach

I built this project using **React functional components and hooks** to ensure a clean and reusable structure.  
The app follows a **component-based architecture**, using **React Router v6** for smooth page navigation.  
User data is fetched from the **JSONPlaceholder API** using Axios, and locally added users are managed with **LocalStorage**.

For styling, I used **external CSS** to maintain a simple, professional white-and-blue theme.  
The design is fully **responsive**, optimized for both desktop and mobile.  
Basic input validation and clean layout ensure a user-friendly experience.
